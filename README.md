# Project 2
This program, when given a set of 0s and 1s, will provide the quickest path when given a start node and a 
goal node depending on which type of search is being used. The 1s are counted as walls whereas you can 
travel through the 0s. You can use three different search methods; depth-first search, breadth-first
search, and A* star search. To run it locally, make sure you have the grid ready in the same file as the 
program. Than, you want to type in the correct command-line arguments. An example would be "./main.py
--input example_file.dat --start 0,0 --goal 6,7 --search A*". After you have these requirements, you're ready to run and it should give you the quickest path.
